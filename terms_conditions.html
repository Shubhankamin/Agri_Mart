    <p>Welcome to <strong>AgriMart</strong>. By accessing or using our website (the “Site”) and our services, you agree to these Terms & Conditions (“Terms”) and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the Site or place orders.</p>

    <h2>1. Definitions & Interpretation</h2>
    <p>“We”, “Us”, “Our”, “AgriMart” refers to AgriMart (your company). “You”, “User”, “Customer” refers to any person accessing or using the Site or placing orders. “Services” means the platform, goods, deliveries, and associated services provided via the Site.</p>

    <h2>2. Scope & Acceptance</h2>
    <p>These Terms govern your access to and use of the Site and Services. They include any additional terms referenced herein or linked from the Site. We may update these Terms at any time — changes will be posted on our Site. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>

    <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 18 years old or act under supervision of a legal guardian to use the Site. Persons not competent to contract (e.g., minors, insolvents) are not permitted to use the Site independently.</p>

    <h2>4. Services & Products</h2>
    <p>We list agricultural products, organic produce, and related goods via our platform. Some items may be offered by third-party sellers. We act as a facilitator; transactions are between you and the seller unless otherwise specified by us.</p>

    <h2>5. Orders & Payments</h2>

      <li>We reserve the right to cancel orders due to stock limitations, pricing errors, or other issues.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>6. Delivery & Risk</h2>
    <p>We will arrange delivery as per our service policies. Delivery times are estimates and may be affected by logistics, weather, or other conditions beyond our control. Once the order is delivered (or left at your direction), risk passes to you.</p>

    <h2>7. Returns, Refunds & Exchanges</h2>
    <p>Because many of our products are perishable, returns or refunds are permitted only in case of defects, damage, or incorrect delivery. You must notify us within a specified timeframe (e.g. 24 hours). We will verify and, if approved, issue refund or replacement as per policy.</p>

    <h2>8. User Obligations</h2>

    <h2>10. Disclaimers & Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>The Site and Services are provided “as is.” To the fullest extent allowed by law, AgriMart disclaims all warranties (express or implied). We shall not be liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from use of the Site or your transactions.</p>

    <h2>13. Miscellaneous</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If a provision is invalid or unenforceable, it will be severed without affecting the rest.</li>
      <li>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Site and Services.</li>
      <li>Failure to enforce any right does not constitute waiver of that right.</li>
    </ul>
